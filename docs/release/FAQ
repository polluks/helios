Q: Is my Pegasos 1 also supported?

A: Yes, as well any Pegasos released! All have the same OHCI1394 chip inside: a VIA-6306.
   This chip provides 3 physical ports: 2 external on the back of the mother board and 1 internal.

Q: And my Mac under MorphOS?

A: I've developped Helios on a Peg2 and a MacMini, so I'm sure that both are supported!
   Now some people have also tested it on PowerMac, even with the FW800 connection
   (but limited to S400).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: In the readme it's written that Helios requiers MorphOS >= 2.x, Doesn't work for 1.4x?

A: I'm developping and testing Helios on a 2.x MorphOS.
    Helios should work also on 1.4.x, it only depends on the pcix.library.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Does Helios handle my Firewire PCI card that i've just plugged?

A: Yes, it should if the chipset is an OHCI one.

Q: I've mounted some partitions on my external Firewire HD, using sbp2.device.
    When I connect another FW device (like my dv-cam), my partition is unmounted!

A: It's normal, annoying, but normal. Connecting, or disconnecting another FW device
    causes the bus to trigs a Bus-Reset event. If your FW HD device is also the root
    device on the bus (the one that handles this Bus-Reset), Helios should not re-uses
    the root units because device may have changed something inside its ROM configuration,
    so its units configuration.
    This units removal causes sbp2 to release units, so unmount all associated partitions.
    It's not possible to fix that because it's the normal process described by norms.
    But we have a chance to forbid your HD device to become root when I'll implement
    the serial bus handler task and force the computer to become the root.
    But it's not a strict rule and your HD may not want to release its root state...
